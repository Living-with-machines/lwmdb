# lib_metadata_db

A pip package containing database access functionality which can be imported in any project requiring this access.

## Installing dependencies

This project uses `poetry` as a package manager. You can read more about it at [`poetry-docs`](<https://python-poetry.org/docs/>). We recommend setting up `poetry` using `pyenv` to install specific versions of `python`, see [here](https://blog.jayway.com/2019/12/28/pyenv-poetry-saviours-in-the-python-chaos/) to manage python versions between local projects.

How to install the dependencies of the project?

```sh
$ poetry install
```

```sh
$ poetry poetry run metadata/manage.py shell_plus --notebook
```
